YOLO Mode for GIT

## What is YOLO Mode?

Well sometimes you can't even bother to keep writing convoluted commit messages.
So with YOLO mode you you will automatically force push every change you make while.

```
Everything?
```

That's right! Everything. If you press save it will be force pushed to origin.
With a very nice commit message that includes a pretty emoji ðŸ˜‰. (Because it's 2017, it needs emojis)

## Usage

Easy!

Simply install it through npm:

```bash
npm install git-yolo -g
```

And start the mode with:

```bash
git-yolo
```
